### PROJECT OVERVIEW  
This application provides a platform for its users to borrow and repay loans from friends and family. If a user needs a loan, he/she makes a request to a friend/family member to grant them a loan. The friend/family member receives the request and views the user's credit history on the application and based on that, they can decide whether to accept or reject the person's loan request. If a loan is approved, the loanee receives the money on their e-wallet on the platform and they can withdraw it for their use. The loanee can then start making payments(through the application) to their family or friend and pay the loan in full (with little or no interest) before the end of the payment period.

### DETAILS
#### Description
It takes a very long time for medical images to be analysed by a radiologist/doctor and during this waiting period, a patient's condition may become worse. This solution aims to reduce the amount of time it takes to scan a medical image hence cutting down on the number of unecessary medical complications 

#### Stack
This is a full stack project with a backend (Python - Django ) and frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap)
